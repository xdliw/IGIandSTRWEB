Lyrics? Yes.
Infected Mushroom? Yes!
What?


I'm fading away from here.
I'm fading away from here.
I'm fading away from here.
I'M FADING AWAY FROM HERE!

I'm fading away from here,
can't see nothing clear. 
Even though I'm awake,
my body slowly breaks.
Feel so cold that I shake, 
every time I reflect.
The story's ready to burst,
I shout to serve my thirst.
It seems to clear my head,
when I'm awake at night.
I pull my thoughts so tight,
when lying in the dark.
Feeling rich with words,
about to draw my sword.
Regretting half my chords,
I'm starting all from scratch.

Take me away.
Shattered my hopes today.
Nothing can be done I see.
All will end so tragically for me.
